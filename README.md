# C-Compiler

> A C language compiler for practice.
> WIP!

The compiler is able to "compile" an expression with addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and brackets.

## Usage

After built, run the program with one argument like the example below:

```shell
C-Compiler "10 + (4 - 3) * 7 + -1" # The result is 16.
```

The assembly will be output into stdout.
You can redirect it into a file and run it.
