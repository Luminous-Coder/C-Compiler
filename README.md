# C-Compiler

> A C language compiler for practice.
> WIP!

## Usage

After built, run the program with one argument like the example below:

```shell
C-Compiler "10 + (4 - 3) * 7 + -1" # The result is 16.
```

The available operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
unary plus, unary minus, relational operators, and equality operators.

The assembly will be output into stdout.
